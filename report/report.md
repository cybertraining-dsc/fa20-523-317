Final Project Plan

•	Title: Big Data Analytics in the National Basketball Association

•	Team: Working Alone on Project

•	Topic: NBA Basketball and Metrics for MVP (Most Valuable Player)

•	Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/drgilermo/nba-players-stats#



Team

In terms of choosing teams, I think working alone is the best option for me at this moment. Going through the NBA statistics is something that I think one person should be able to reasonably accomplish.



## 1. Plan of Action

•	Describing the NBA game

There are many individuals who may be aware of basketball but not knowledgeable enough to understand my report. So, I’ll give a little background on the NBA game and how things have transpired in generations.

•	Describing Analytics Impacts

As stated earlier above, I talked about certain points in how certain changes due to analytics have enhanced the game of basketball and how this was spurred through the Golden State Warriors.

•	Demonstrating the Data

To show the impacts of the data, I was planning to compile the data from the different datasets and demonstrate them in graphs and bars for readers to better understand the message I’m trying to display.



## 2. Topic

For now, the topic that I’m going with revolves around the National Basketball Association and the deciding factors in understanding how certain awards such as the MVP (Most Valuable Player) and DPOY (Defensive Player of the Year) are awarded. There has been a lot of controversy surrounding this topic as many individuals feel as if storylines and politics are the determinant of who wins these respective awards. 

In addition to the above another interesting topic that can be investigated is the leagues implementation of analytics to determine the way basketball has been played. Countless examples could be shown through small-ball lineups and the transition to heavy amounts of three-point shot attempts that occurred in the league the past five years. The results have been shown as seemingly every year the league breaks their scoring records and a team always breaks offensive records on a yearly basis.

Many individuals attribute Stephen Curry, a 6-3 NBA point guard, to the change in analytics. The year Steph Curry broke through as an All-Star. This was the year that his team the Golden State Warriors broke the former Chicago Bulls record of 72-9. This in big part was due to Steph Curry breaking the 3pt record as well as Golden State adopting the small ball philosophy. This particular year gave birth to the era of analytics because of how dominate those two approaches were.


## 3. Introduction

The National Basketball Association was first created in the year of 1946 with the name of BAA (Basketball Association of America). However, in 1949 the name was changed to the NBA with a total of 17 teams.[^3] As time progressed the league started picking up steam and more and more teams began to join and it wasn’t until the 90’s that we see the total amount of NBA teams be produced. 

To better understand the basis of analysis, the game of basketball needs to be understood first. The National Basketball Association builds its organizations on the backs of mostly 20-year-old individuals who are standouts at their respective regions of the United States. Making the NBA is nearly an impossible feat as only a minor 60 players get drafted on a yearly basis. In terms of the draft, most individuals are screened and selected from college. Previously, the NBA allowed individuals to come straight from high school, however, the rule changed so that there was a one year of college eligibility status that had to be met.

When it comes to on-court play, there are a total of five positions: point guard, shooting guard, small forward, power forward and center. Each takes up a specific spot on the floor with the guards at around the three-point line and the forwards and center inside or surrounding the paint. 


## 4. Dataset

At this moment the current dataset that I’m utilizing consists of all NBA players and certain statistics of theirs dating back to 1950’s when stats were starting to get recorded. However, I feel as if another data set would be necessary to quantify the impacts of what the three-pointer and positional basketball has done for basketball. 

My plan is to take the data and demonstrate through bars and graphs the impacts of these changes from the modern NBA to the classic NBA and the differences that were shown through that. Using Notebook might be needed to get all the data visualized for the report. Another option is to take a look at a datasets and determine how MVP’s are decided and see what criteria is normally met for this. I will look at things such as position and statistics within items such as : assists, points, and rebounds and determine what is normally needed. In addition to this, we plan on using other datasets to confirm the analytical aspect of basketball in comparison to how MVP's win their respective awards.
